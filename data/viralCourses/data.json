In Angular, it monkey-patches common asynchronous APIs (like setTimeout, Promises, and XHR). When an async operation completes, Zone.js notifies Angular, which then triggers change detection to ensure the view is synchronized with the model. Without Zone.js (or manual triggering), Angular wouldn't know when to update the DOM after an event."

OnPush tells Angular that this component only depends on its inputs.

In Composition API, 'onMounted' is typically used if you need to ensure the component is in the DOM, or you can simply trigger the fetch in 'setup' (which corresponds to beforeCreate/created).

Without keys, Vue uses an algorithm that minimizes element movement and tries to patch/reuse elements of the same type in-place. With keys, it can reorder elements based on the movement of keys, which is much more efficient and prevents bugs with stateful child components or temporary DOM state (like input focus)."

It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) and is now used in Java and other platforms as well."
