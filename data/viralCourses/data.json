By using a private key to sign a hash of the document, any change in the document will result in a hash mismatch (integrity). Since only the sender has the private key, they cannot later claim they did not sign it (non-repudiation). Symmetric encryption provides confidentiality, and hashing alone provides integrity but not non-repudiation."
